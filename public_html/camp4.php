					<h4>CAMP - Phase IV</h4> <br>
<p>SCOPE:<br>Development of passive samplers and windshield to introduced and develop low cost passive sampling techniques to monitor long term air quality levels at more locations with high resolution within the city of Colombo and suburban areas that could study the spatial and diurnal variations of air quality levels to identify Potential Air Pollution Hazards Risk Areas <br><br>
DURATION: <br>2001 - 2008 <br><br>
STUDY AREA :<br>The study area is the city of Colombo, commercial capital of Sri Lanka and suburban areas.<br><br>
SAMPLING LOCATIONS: <br>Fifteen (15) sampling locations were randomly identified to represent different land use patterns within the Colombo city limits and surrounding suburban areas.<br><br>

PASSIVE SAMPLER :<br>
 Developed at National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) laboratory and fabricated locally. The sampler is validated by comparing the data with “Ogawa” sampler,  automated air quality monitoring systems and  passive sampling intercomparision programme conducted by male declaration programme.<br>  <br>
 WIND SHIELD:<br>
A new wind shield has been designed and developed at Environmental Division Laboratory (EDL) of NBRO which is more reliable then than Ogawa wind shied and not disturb which minimise disturbance to air flow.
