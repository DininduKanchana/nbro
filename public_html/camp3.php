<p>SCOPE: Monitoring of ambient Air Quality Using Automated Systems<br>
<br>Recognizing the growing problem of air pollution and the importance of having a proper air quality monitoring system in the Colombo Urban area, World Bank mission in 1992 on the Colombo Urban Transport Project (CUTP) incorporated this monitoring programme as a tool for a proper air pollution management programme in Colombo with the objective of reducing air pollution in Colombo by year 2000. <br><br>

INTRODUCTION: <br>Under this programme two fixed and one mobile air quality and meteorological monitoring stations were commissioned in December 1996. Each unit could measure ambient SO2, NO, NO2, NOx, CO, O3, PM-10 levels and the meteorological parameters such as Wind Direction (WD), Wind Speed (WS), Vertical Wind Speed (VWS), Solar Radiation (SR), Ambient Temperature (ATE) and Precipitation (RF), continuously. In compliance with the recommendation of the World Bank and the Clean Air 2000 Action Plan Committee, this monitoring programme is being executed by the Environmental Division of NBRO for the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). <br><br>
