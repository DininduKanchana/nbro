    				            Presently, Vehicular Emission Testing Program (VET) is the major on-going activity in air quality
                                management in Sri Lanka. As one of the activity identified under the VET programme is Air Quality
                                Monitoring in urban areas to assess the exiting levels and to analysed pollution trends and of
                                the variations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the management activities related to ambient
                                air pollution. The Air Quality Status Monitoring Program under the VET programme was started
                                in 2012 at major cities (Colombo, Gampaha, Horana, Kaluthara, Rathnapura and Galle) in Sri Lanka
                                by using passive air quality monitoring techniques. The program was continued to collect monthly
                                average concentrations of SO2 and NO2 data till end of the year 2014 including the Kandy city
                                in addition to above cities.

                                The objective of the 2016 program is to obtain continuous ambient air quality database at above
                                selected major urban areas where the monitoring program has been already implemented while data
                                validation by comparing automated air quality sampling technique. Total of 77 sampling points
                                will be covered in the existing monitoring program and additional 7 points will be introduced
                                in year 2016. In the monitoring program the Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
                                levels in ambient air will be monitored monthly,
